high prio:

medium prio:

background image is compressed when it does not fit on the screen, like in landscape mode on the xperia

separat view file fÃ¶r tablets:
- vertical list -> horizontal scroll
-- testa med snabb emulator, nexus 7
- problem: horizontal swipe-based navigation is not compatible with horizontal scrolling

low prio:

widget 2: display random covers like in WP8

encrypt endpoint passwords in shared prefs

pimp web play support
- ok not to implement

bug:
the circle of the vertical volume seekbar drops to 0 if the volume is changed programmatically, although the bar works

IAP flow
App starts -> MainActivity
Read the unlimited playback preference
Read hasPurchase
- if returns successfully, set allowUnlimited to result
- if fails, do not modify preference
-- so if the user is offline, the previously valid state applies

User goes to IAP page -> InAppBillingActivity
Preference listener that updates UI as required
Read preference
If true, display congrats, hide others
If false
- load inventory with specific SKU
- display button, details
User clicks button, perform purchase
- on success, update UI
- on failure, update UI

release checklist:
- update version
- enable aggressive ProGuard caching
- clean; packageRelease
